**lite-xl configuration**

plugins (if any) always have the default keybinds and configuration.

fonts are required by the plugins or color themes, but can very easily be replaced.

`cp -r ./lite-xl ~/.config/lite-xl`

or the following to overwrite existing files if any (e.g. `init.lua`):

`yes | cp -rf ./lite-xl ~/.config/lite-xl`
